Predicting Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for Mental Health Disorders

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) associated with mental health disorders for different countries. DALYs provide a comprehensive measure of the burden of disease by considering both mortality and disability. By accurately predicting DALYs, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the impact of mental health disorders on population health and guide policy decisions, resource allocation, and intervention strategies.

Scope:
The project focuses on mental health disorders, including anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, depressive disorders, and other relevant conditions. It considers data from the years 1990 to 2019, covering a 30-year period. The analysis is conducted at a country level, aiming to provide predictions and insights for each individual country.
